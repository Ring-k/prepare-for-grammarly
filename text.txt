The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec: out-of-order data} formally describes the workload, including the definition of time-series data, delays, in-order and out-of-order data points. 
Because the WA is strongly related to the intensity of the disorder, we define a model to quantify the disorder intensity: the arrival rate ratio of in-order and out-of-order data. In Section \ref{sec: subsequent data}, given the delays' distribution, generation time interval, we define the subsequent data points and use their count to build the WA model under $\pi_c$. In Section \ref{sec: separation policy}, we show the writing under $\pi_s$ in detail, and then we build the model of WA under $\pi_s$. Subsequently, based on the models, a tuning algorithm is given to minimize the WA. Section  \ref{sec: experiments} conducts simulation experiments on twelve synthetic datasets to confirm that the proposed models can accurately estimate WA under $\pi_c$ and $\pi_s$, and the tuning algorithm works well. We also discuss the impact of $\pi_s$ on writing throughput, read amplification and query performance.
