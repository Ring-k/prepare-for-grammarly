The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 formally describes the workload, including the definition of time-series data, delays, in-order and out-of-order data points. 
Because the WA is strongly related to the intensity of the disorder, we define a model to quantify the disorder intensity: the arrival rate ratio of in-order and out-of-order data. In Section 1, given the delays' distribution, generation time interval, we define the subsequent data points and use their count to build the WA model under C. In Section 1, we show the writing under C in detail, and then we build the model of WA under C. Subsequently, based on the models, a tuning algorithm is given to minimize the WA. Section  1 conducts simulation experiments on twelve synthetic datasets to confirm that the proposed models can accurately estimate WA under C and C, and the tuning algorithm works well. We also discuss the impact of C on writing throughput, read amplification and query performance.
